     <h2>Principles of Web Design</h2>
        <p>All of us rely on the internet to conduct our daily lives, complete homework assignments, and interact with our peers, yet for something so commonly and widely used, most of us do not understand how the world wide web works. This workshop examines how web pages are created, stored, and shared with the world. </p>
    
    <h2>Introduction to HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML and CSS are languages that form the structure and styling of a website. In this workshop, we will be learning the basic syntax of both languages and practice using a text editor (Visual Studio Code) to create a static web page. </p>
     <p>For the purpose of this workshop, I have also created a few sites as examples and visual goals. </p>
    
    <h3>Example pages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="bare.html">Barebones HTML page</a></li>
            <li><a href="eg_HTML.html">Headings HTML page</a></li>
            <li><a href="nyctrivia1.html">Our project goal before lunch break</a></li>
            <li><a href="nyctrivia2.html">Our project goal for the end of the workshop</a></li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages</h2>
     <p>Git and GitHub are powerful tools for collaborative and individual projects. Git is a version control software that aids with tracking changes made to a set of files over time. GitHub is a web-based platform for storing, sharing, and collaborating on project files online. This session begins with a conceptual overview of both tools, including an introduction to fundamental concepts such as version control and practical applications for students and scholars, followed by an applied introduction to getting started with these tools. We will end the session by “hosting” the static web page we created on GitHub Pages, a free and quick alternative to other web hosting platforms.</p>
